# Alara Kit

Frontend framework for Alara projects

## Introduction

I recognize there are a plethora of frontend frameworks in the wild currently. But in an effort to keep our projects somewhat uniform, I have created this kit for all Alara projects to start from.

I've opened this to the public, but really, you'll probably get more mileage out of a more commercial framework like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) or [Bulma](http://bulma.io).

## Documentation

Eventually, yes...
