# Alara Kit
Frontend framework for Alara projects

I recognize there are a plethora of frontend frameworks in the wild currently. But in an effort to keep our projects somewhat uniform, I have created this kit for all Alara projects to start from.

I've opened this to the public, but really, you'll probably get more mileage out of a more commercial framework like Bootstrap or Bulma.
